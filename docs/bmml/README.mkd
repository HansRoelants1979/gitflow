### Introduction
Vincent created nice figures to describe git model using keynotes format, it is a pity for non-Apple guys.

Larry Cai <larry.caiyu@gmail.com> is fans of <http://www.balsamiq.com/>.

So balsamiq's bmml format are created during my study of git.

Hopefully it can be merged back by Vincent ;-)

Several good features for bmml format
* It is cool same as keynotes, and availability under more platform (depends on Adobe AIR)
* plain text (XML format), keep small size in git and transfer
* balsamiq is friendly to open source development, could get it free
* .. (you can add it)
